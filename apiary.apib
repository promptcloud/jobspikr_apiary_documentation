# JobsPikr API


JobsPikr API helps you interact and use the data provided by JobsPikr. 

There are three APIs here:

* Job Search API - search for jobs based on various criteria.

* Expired Jobs API - get all (consumed) jobs expired on a given date range.


This document covers the concepts related to API, its usage and some illustrative examples and use cases. 

For help with specific queries, you may also check our query builder helper at https://app.jobspikr.com/my/query_builder


## Concepts

Details on some of the concepts to better use our API.

### API URL

Our regular endpoint is

https://api.jobspikr.com/v2 .

In case of persistent issues, you may also use the following URL as fallback

https://api-bcp.jobspikr.com/v2 

### API Keys

To interact with the API, you need an API key., which can be taken from the link https://app.jobspikr.com/my/api_keys. 

There are two sets of API keys - one for production, that hosts the actual data, and the other for sandbox, mainly used for testing purposes. 

Data obtained using Sandbox credentials will not be deducted from your credits.
Also, our Sandbox API contains only a subset of job data from `1 June 2019 -31 July 2019`.

### Authentication

The JobsPikr API uses API keys to authenticate your requests. You can view and manage your API keys here:

https://app.jobspikr.com/my/api_keys

Authentication to the API can be performed in three ways:
* HTTP Basic Auth - provide your client_id and client_auth_key as username and password in the Basic Auth.
* In Headers - provide client_id and client_auth_key as Headers.
* In Body - provide the client_id and client_auth_key as parameters in the body of the request.

All the examples in this documentation send client_id and client_auth_key via Headers.

### Job credit

* Job credit refers to each job data that is consumed from our platform. 
* These credits are valid as per your billing cycle.
* Each job consumed using production key via API or downloaded by logging in to www.app.jobspikr.com  counts towards credit.
* Jobs accessed from API using sandbox credentials don't count towards anything.

### Sandbox API

If you are just exploring the API or testing your queries or for any form of tests, please use the Sandbox API credentials obtained from here

https://app.jobspikr.com/my/api_keys

* Jobs available for Sandbox credentials are only a subset of job data from `1 March 2021 - 30 April 2021`.
* Jobs accessed from API using sandbox credentials don't count towards anything.


## Request and Response Data format

* All the input and params passed to the API should be in `UTF-8` and in JSON format.
* Response can be either in JSON(default) or XML format.
* Response will always have two fields `status` and `message`.
* Other fields in the response might vary depending upon the endpoint accessed and will be described later in this document.


## Cursor in API Query for pagination

Our API supports cursor, which is primarily a mechanism to consume data in smaller chunks when the overall number of records is too high.

### How to use the cursor?
1. Send a request with/without the cursor.
2. Take the next_cursor value from the response.
3. Use it as the value for cursor argument in the next request body.
4. Repeat step 2 & 3 until you get `"status":"no_data"` in the response.
5. When you get `no_data` it means there is no more data present for the given query at that time. Store the cursor in a file or DB.
6. Try sending an API request with the stored cursor value after an hour(minimum). If there is any new data added, which satisfies the given query in the last 1 hour, it will be returned.
7. Repeat steps 2-7 to keep getting data.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I be charged for consuming/downloading the same jobs again?

Even though you consumed the same records multiple times - either by making the same query again or across different queries satisfying the same condition -
your volume credits will be deducted for the unique records consumed in a given credit cycle(30 days period). The counter in the dashboard here https://app.jobspikr.com/ 
shows the number of unique records consumed either via API or file download. We update this counter every one hour where we get the number of unique records consumed
so far by your account for the current billing cycle.

### What is the period in which job credits are counted and repeated job consumption ignored?

Your job credits are valid for 30 days (Each billing cycle). These credits can be consumed via the JobsPikr API or file download. When your billing cycle is reset, the job credits are reset as per your plan



### I am getting too many results for my queries

This happens if your queries are too generic. We suggest you try to restrict the search term, post dates or location to get specific results. 
Some of these cases are explained in the example below. Please go over them and if the issue still persists please reach out to us by creating a support ticket.

### Will my  credits be carried forward to the next month?
Your job credits are applicable to your current billing cycle (30 days) only and are not carried forward to the next month.

### Where can I get more details about search_query_json?

We use Elasticsearch to store and retrieve all the job records, hence `search_query_json` can take in whatever `query` accepts as per Elasticsearch.
But we internally use only these two queries to construct all our queries - [query_string](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/query-dsl-query-string-query.html)
and [bool](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.6/query-dsl-bool-query.html).

If you don't know Elasticsearch queries, it’s not a problem at all. We don't want you to go through those documents as well.
We've given an extensive list of examples explaining how each and every query is built for multiple scenarios (#reference/examples/job-search-api).  They should help you understand how this works.


Also, we have a [query builder](https://app.jobspikr.com/my/query_builder) which will help you build the most common queries.

In case you still need more help, please reach out to our support and we would be happy to help.

# Group Job Search API

## Endpoint Details [/data]

### Job Search Using POST Requests [POST]

This endpoint is the workhorse of the API.  the backbone of API can Regular job searches. Please note that even though this is a GET request, even the POST request gives the same result. Which we have illustrated later

#### Fields in Request Header

- client_id `String` `REQUIRED` - This is your unique client identification string to access JobsPikr API

- client_auth_key `String` `REQUIRED` - This your unique client authentication key to access JobsPikr API

Both `client_id` and `client_auth_key` can be obtained from here. https://app.jobspikr.com/my/api_keys. 

Please use Sandbox API credentials for testing our API responses, so that your job credits are not deducted  while testing our API.

#### Fields in Request Body

- search_query_json `JSON` `REQUIRED` - Search query generated by you for which the data will be returned. This search query string takes a JSON object as input. More information on this field can be found [here](#reference/examples/job-search-api)

- size `String` `OPTIONAL`-  The number of records to be returned for this request. It can be between 10 and 100. This is an optional parameter with a default value of 100. Size should not be a part of search query JSON and should be always sent separately as mentioned here.

- format `String` `OPTIONAL` - The format of the response from API. It can be either 'JSON' or 'XML'. This is an optional parameter with a default value of 'JSON'.

- cursor `String` `OPTIONAL` - This for pagination. API response can contain a maximum of 100 records but if there are 2000 records present and to get everything, you can use this cursor argument. This argument should not be mentioned inside of _search_query_json_ and should always be sent separately.
Please check [How to use cusor?](#introduction/cursor-in-api-query-for-pagination/how-to-use-the-cursor?) for learning more about cusor.


#### Fields in Response Body

Depending upon whether 'JSON' or 'XML' was passed in the format field of the query,  A JSON or XML object will be returned all the following properties.

- status - The status of the response. It can be either these three
    
    _'success'_, if the request is processed successfully and data is returned.

    _'no_data'_ in case the request processes  successfully but there is no more data present for the given query.

    _'error'_ in case of some problem with processing the request.

- message -  The message explaining the status of the response.
- total_count - Number of records present in total for the query given in the request. If this number is more than 100 or the size specified in the request, you can use the `next_cursor` from the response as `cursor` in subsequent request to get all the data.
- job_credit_remaining -  Number of job data that is left to be consumed as per the plan subscription.
- job_data - An array of objects of job data. The format  could be JSON or XML, depending upon what was passed in the format field in the query.
- next_cursor - The cursor to be used in the next request  to get the subsequent data for the query.
- size - Number of records present in the current response.

### Job Search Using GET Request [GET]

Instead of using a [post request](https://jobspikr.docs.apiary.io/#reference/job-search-api/endpoint-details/job-search-using-post-requests), 
you can use get request as well to get job records. All the header parameter, body parameters are the same for both `POST` and `GET` request.

Few libraries don’t support adding body to a GET request, hence we've enabled POST request as well for all the endpoints discussed in this documentation. 

That said, this documentation tool that we've used also doesn't support body in GET request, hence trying out this particular request in the right-side console won't work.

+ Request (application/json)

# Group Aggregation API 

* **Each request to this endpoint will consume 100 volume credits.** 

Aggregate data endpoint aggregates the entire data available in Jobspikr based on the query passed and returns the number of job data present for each aggregation. As of now two levels of aggregation is only possible.

#### Fields in Request Header

- client_id `String` `REQUIRED` - This is your unique client identification string to access JobsPikr API

- client_auth_key `String` `REQUIRED` - This is your unique client authentication key to access JobsPikr API

Both `client_id` and `client_auth_key` can be obtained from here. https://app.jobspikr.com/my/api_keys. 

#### Fields in Request Body

- search_query_json (String, REQUIRED) - Search query generated by you for which the data will be returned. This search query string takes a JSON object as input. To know more about how to construct the search query please [read this](#introduction/frequently-asked-questions/where-can-i-get-more-details-about-search-query-json?) or explore our [query builder](https://app.jobspikr.com/my/query_builder). In case of aggregate API, instead of returning the job data for this request, the given aggregation will be applied on top of this query.
- aggregate_by (String, REQUIRED) - The JSON which instructs the API to aggregate based on the fields provided. Two levels of aggregation are possible. The structure of this object is given below

aggregate_by JSON structure

- ‘field_1’ - (String, REQUIRED) mentions the field on the top of which the top-level aggregation should be done on.
- ‘size_1’ - (Integer, REQUIRED) mentions the number of aggregated results that should be returned from the API for top level aggregation.
- field_2 - (String, REQUIRED) mentions the field on the top of which the sub aggregation should be done.
- ‘size_2’ - (Integer OPTIONAL) mentions the number of aggregated results that should be from API for sub aggregation.

Please note that field_1 or field_2 must be from the following list - ‘company_name’, ‘inferred_country’, ‘post_date’.

If the field parameter is ‘post_date’ then ‘size’ parameter is not required, instead ‘interval’ parameter should be used(value for 'interval' can only be month or quarter.

**Important notes**

W.r.t size.  size parameters(size_1, size_2) when used can’t go above 10000.
* If only one level of aggregation is used, size_1 should be  <= 10000. 
* If two level of aggregations are used, **size_1 + (size_1 * size_2)** should be <= 10000

Like other endpoints in  JobsPikr, here too GET and POST both request types will work.

## Sample Requests [/aggregate_data]

### Aggregate by company_name and inferred_country [GET]

### Find all jobs from London, United Kingdom [POST]

To get all the jobs from 'London, United Kingdom', we have to use `bool` query with `must` condition. The query will look like this
```
  "bool": {
    "must": [
      {
        "query_string": {
          "fields": [
            "country",
            "inferred_country"
          ],
          "query": "\"United Kingdom\" OR \"England\" OR \"UK\""
        }
      },
      {
        "query_string": {
          "fields": [
            "city",
            "inferred_city"
          ],
          "query": "\"London\""
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```
* Here there are two queries inside must, each checking for country match and city match respectively. We use `must`, because, the results returned
will satisfy both the queries specified inside must.
* Instead of just city London, we check for city London and country United Kingdom because city names are not unique. There are city with name 'London' in
The United States and Canada as well. Hence to be more specific we use both city and country.
* We search for 'London' in both  “city” and “inferred city” fields and 'United Kingdom' in both “country” and “inferred country” fields to give us better coverage.
* Try to use all city, state and country along with respective inferred fields in all your custom queries for better results.

### Find all jobs from  Sydney, Australia OR Seattle, USA [POST]

To get the jobs from different location we should use `bool` query with `should` condition. Inside should we should use multiple `bool` queries with `must`
as given in the previous example. For the given example, to find all jobs from Sydney, Australia OR Seattle, USA, the `bool` query will look like the following.
```
  {
    "bool": {
      "should": [
        {
          "bool": {
            "must": [
              {
                "query_string": {
                  "fields": [
                    "country",
                    "inferred_country"
                  ],
                  "query": "\"Australia\""
                }
              },
              {
                "query_string": {
                  "fields": [
                    "state",
                    "inferred_state"
                  ],
                  "query": "\"New South Wales\""
                }
              },
              {
                "query_string": {
                  "fields": [
                    "city",
                    "inferred_city"
                  ],
                  "query": "\"Sydney\""
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "bool": {
            "must": [
              {
                "query_string": {
                  "fields": [
                    "country",

                  ],
                  "query": "\"United States\" OR \"USA\" OR \"United States\" OR \"US\""
                }
              },
              {
                "query_string": {
                  "fields": [
                    "state",
                    "inferred_state"
                  ],
                  "query": "\"Washington\" OR \"wa\""
                }
              },
              {
                "query_string": {
                  "fields": [
                    "city",
                    "inferred_city"
                  ],
                  "query": "\"Seattle\""
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```
Here the `should` condition acts as `OR` and must condition acts as `AND`. Hence the query that is given above states
```
    ((city: Sydney) AND (state: New South Wales) AND (country: Australia)) OR ((city: Seattle) AND (state: Washington) AND (country: United States))

### Find all the jobs which don't have Undefined in the job type [POST]

Few of the job records have 'Undefined' as the value for `job_type` field. This is because not all the jobs have a job type mentioned in the source URL.
If we want to get only the job records which have a valid `job_type` mentioned, we can query for all jobs that don’t have 'Undefined' as the job type.

To ignore records based on the value we can use `bool` query with `must_not` condition. The query for our use case will look like below
```
        "bool": {
          "must_not": [
            {
              "query_string": {
                "fields": [
                  "job_type"

                "query": "undefined"
              }
            }
          ]
